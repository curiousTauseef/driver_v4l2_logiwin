Binding for Xylon logiWIN versatile video input IP core

Required properties:
 - compatible: "xylon,logiwin-4.00.a"
 - reg: MMIO base address and size of the logiWIN IP core address space
 - interrupts-parent: the phandle for interrupt controller
 - interrupts: the interrupt number
 - input-num: number of connected video inputs (currently allowed only 1)
 - input-format: video input format (dvi, itu, rgb)
 - input-resolution: video input resolution
 - output-format: output pixel format written to video buffer
 - output-resolution: video input resolution
      First resolution parameter defines logiWIN IP core output memory stride
      (512, 1024, 2048).
      Second resolution parameter defines vertical video resolution (max 2048).
 - output-byte-align:
 - scale-fraction-bits:
 - hw-buffer-switch: defined if hw tripple buffering is suported

Optional properties:
 - vmem-address: video buffer address with range to store grabbed frame
      If omitted, driver will allocate buffer from kernel CMA space.

Example:

	logiwin_sata_0: logiwin@40010000 {
		compatible = "xylon,logiwin-4.00.a";
		reg = <0x40010000 0x1000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		interrupts = <0 30 4>;
		vmem-address = <0x38000000 0x1000000>;
		input-num = <1>;
		input-format = "itu";
		input-resolution = <1280 720>;
		output-format = "yuyv";
		output-resolution = <2048 1080>;
		output-byte-align = <2>;
		scale-fraction-bits = <6>;
		//hw-buffer-switch; 
	};


DRIVER USAGE NOTES:
   This driver supports two modes: standard frame capture mode and
    video overlay mode.

   Frame capture mode
   ------------------
   This mode currently implements software tripple buffering mechanism (logiWIN DMA
   write address is set to one of the three buffers at each frame interrupt).
   Buffering between application and driver is done using standard VIDIOC_DQBUF
   and VIDIOC_QBUF calls. Memory mapping of the DMA video buffers into application space
   is done in cached mode, driver does not ensure cache coherency of the video buffers.
   To ensure cache coherency logiWIN must be connected over cache coherent Zynq ACP port.
   Application must ensure the the video buffers are dequeued from the driver faster than
   1/(input FPS), other wise frames will be lost.
   Used calls: VIDIOC_REQBUFS (3 buffers), VIDIOC_QUERYBUF, VIDIOC_STREAMON, VIDIOC_DQBUF,
               VIDIOC_QBUF (V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_CAPTURE, V4L2_MEMORY_MMAP)
   
   Video overlay mode
   ------------------
   This mode supports hw tripple buffering between logiWIN and typically display controller 
   (e.g. logiCVC). See logiWIN user manual for connection of tripple buffering logiWIN signals
   in FPGA. Driver requires that hw-buffer-switch is defined in dts.
   Used calls:  VIDIOC_REQBUFS (3 buffers), VIDIOC_QUERYBUF, V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_OVERLAY, VIDIOC_S_FBUF,
                 VIDIOC_S_FBUF
